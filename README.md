# Digital-Attendance-Management-System
The Digital Attendance Management System(DAMS) is a technologically simple solution designed to digitize the attendance tracking process in educational institutions. Traditional attendance management methods often suffer from inefficiencies, inaccuracies, and time-consuming manual processes. To overcome these challenges, this project proposes the development of a web based attendance system using PHP and MySQL. 
Admin (Administrator User) is responsible for setting up the entire system such as adding subjects, teachers, etc.  During the attendance, the teacher shall mark the attendance and push it to the database via his/her web portal. The system shall be user-friendly, accurate, and efficient, making it an ideal solution for educational institutions. Compared to existing traditional attendance marking system, this system reduces the workload. Similarly, this system shall be simple to manage and cost-effective when compared to usual smart attendance management systems.
